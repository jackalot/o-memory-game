focus: plan out how this project will make the memory cards be created:

+ App.js will call a new file called ScoreCounter: {
    + it will then create a number array of 12 numbers, 1-12
    + make an empty array called newOrder;
    + loop through the number array
    {
        + check if the current index in the number array does not exist already in newOrder
        {
            + add a random number to new newOrder with the greatest number being 12
        }
    }
    + use the Set method to have a collection of unique values. 
    + make a for loop that loops through the number array again {
        + on each iteration, check if the newOrder doesn't have this number{
            if it doesn't, push it to the end
        }
    }
}
