focus: plan out the scoring system now that we can store in state each number:
/** This function will check our number that clicked on a card for: */ 
+ add a new function called checkNumber (number) {
 + a reference to indexOf() our number and being called off the storedNumbers array;
 + if( this number is NOT in the storedNumbers array)
 {
     + call storeNumber();
 }
 + if(this number is in the storedNumbers array)
 {
     do nothing for now.
 }
}
